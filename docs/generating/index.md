This gives the details of how the Mojo tutorials (as the sanity check tutorial) were generated using Pocket Flow and how to prepare yourself for that usage of Pocket Flow.

## Warmups, Exercises and Sanity Checks

Before tackling a huge, new repo from Modular with a very new, highly abstract framework like Pocket Flow, I took some baby steps.

### Warming up with the Difficulties of the Pocket Flow Demo

I had many difficulties with Pocket Flow which I now blieve are largely Pocket Flow itself is new. I complained at length with both Perplexity and also with OpenAI:
- [long-winded inquiry with Perplexity Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/3f2e2e35-45fc-4ac2-8556-b4a6d5ef6540)
- [far more consice Page report from Perplexity of the long-winded chat](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/questions-about-pocketflow-llm-j2Wg1rCdSbO3F2prOGIQig)
- [OpenAIâ€™s Quick, Pointed Reply with o4-mini-high](https://chatgpt.com/share/6827620e-0800-800d-a83c-e216698046d6)

### Preliminary Exercise with the Pocket Flow Demo in Zach's: [Pocket Flow Cookbook](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/tree/main/cookbook)

The biggest difficulty I had was difficulty the `.ipynb` demo in Cursor and undertook to develop each of its 4 parts as individual demos. Using a different notebook server in Cursor is likely a viable option, but I did not pursue that.
- I honestly don't like NoteBooks and prefer the more old-fashioned, file-oriented style of development.
- It was a successful training exercise.  Part 4 of 4 was the most difficult.

I did this initial prompt in Cursor using Sonnet 3.7 MAX with Zach's CookBook:
```
You an expert in PocketFlow, i.e., Zachary Huang who developed PocketFlow. What kind of a graph in PocketFlow would you create to implement a RAG chatbot that, given a userâ€™s input question, finds the most relevant file based on embeddings and then answers the user's question. Test it with a shared store that has preloaded all text files from @/Users/sam/Projects/the-pocketflow/cookbook/data/PaulGrahamEssaysLarge.
```
and followed it up with:
```
Great. Now integrate all the Python code you created into a single file along with the required utilities.
```
The chatbot in Cursor generated `rag_chatbot.py`. After some struggles with `init/call_llm.py` using a Sonnet model for its API purposes, I finally got a good result:
```
(venv) (base) sam@Samuels-MacBook-Pro the-pocketflow % python rag_chatbot.py
--- Starting Indexing Phase ---
Loaded 5 documents
Created 101 chunks from 5 documents
Generated 101 embeddings
Index created with 101 chunks and 101 embeddings
Documents indexed: {'addiction.txt', 'apple.txt', 'before.txt', 'avg.txt', 'aord.txt'}

--- Starting Query Phase ---
Enter your question: What's the best way to get an idea for a startup?
Question: What's the best way to get an idea for a startup?
Retrieved chunks from: ['before.txt', 'before.txt', 'before.txt']

Answer: Turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort.

### A Preliminary Sanity Check: Hello World

From his CookBook (#TODO Ref?), I also did the Hello World example:

1. **pocketflow-hello-world**: Basic starter example showing simple question-answering with minimal PocketFlow implementation.
2. **pocketflow-rag**: Demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation with document chunking, vector embeddings, and relevant content retrieval for better LLM responses.
3. **pocketflow-agent**: Implements a decision-making research agent that can search the web and decide when to seek more information versus answering directly.
4. **pocketflow-batch**: Shows batch processing for translating content into multiple languages simultaneously, demonstrating parallel task handling.
5. **pocketflow-multi-agent**: Implements async communication between two AI agents playing a Taboo word guessing game, showcasing complex agent interactions.
6. **pocketflow-flow**: Likely demonstrates basic flow creation and management in PocketFlow.
7. **pocketflow-node**: Probably focuses on creating and using different node types.
8. **pocketflow-chat**: Simple chatbot implementation showcasing conversation handling.
9. **pocketflow-chat-memory**: Enhanced chatbot with conversation history/memory capabilities.
10. **pocketflow-chat-guardrail**: Chatbot with safety guardrails and content filtering.
11. **pocketflow-tool-** series (crawler, database, embeddings, pdf-vision, search): Examples of integrating various external tools with PocketFlow.
12. **pocketflow-text2sql**: Converts natural language to SQL queries using LLMs.
13. **pocketflow-map-reduce**: Implements the MapReduce pattern for parallel data processing and aggregation.
14. **pocketflow-async-basic**: Shows basic asynchronous operations within PocketFlow.
15. **pocketflow-parallel-batch**: Demonstrates running multiple batch processes in parallel.
16. **pocketflow-structured-output**: Examples of getting structured data (JSON/YAML) from LLMs.
17. **pocketflow-visualization**: Tools for visualizing PocketFlow graphs and execution.
```
(venv) pocketflow-hello-world % python main.py       
Question: In one sentence, what's the end of universe?
Answer: The end of the universe could manifest as the "heat death," where it reaches a state of maximum entropy and no thermodynamic free energy remains to sustain processes, leading to darkness and uniformity.
```

### The Final Sanity Check: Crawl4AI

Ramping up to bigger Pocket Flow runs, I reviewed the tutorials in [Zach's repo](#TODO)

I chose Craw4AI because it seemed to me to be the most ordinary of purpose, i.e., it was quite pedestrian. (No pun intended. ðŸ˜ƒ).

## Generating the Mojo Tutorials
In a separate project folder, I simply cloned the Modular repo and switched to the stable branch per their recommendations:
```
TBD
```


#TODO - Eventually, when reading my Obisidan notes, I will come across the details for the comparisons I made and puts them into the two files in the `Comparisons/` folder.



I used Python 3.12.7 with `venv`.
