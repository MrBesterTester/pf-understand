# Tutorial: mojo

The `mojo` project provides a core data structure called **NDBuffer**, which is a *non-owning, multi-dimensional view* into a block of memory, similar to a tensor. It's designed for high-performance computing by allowing direct memory manipulation via `UnsafePointer`s and supporting *efficient element access* through `Strides and Offset Computation`. `NDBuffer` can handle both *statically known and dynamically determined* dimension sizes using `DimList` and `Dim` abstractions, and it facilitates `SIMD Data Access` for accelerated, vectorized operations on data.
