# Tutorial: mojo

The project `mojo` (as represented by these abstractions) provides a system for **high-performance, multi-dimensional array (tensor) operations**.
It features `NDBuffer` as a central data structure that acts as a *smart view over raw memory*, pointed to by an `UnsafePointer`.
The `NDBuffer`'s structure (shape and memory layout strides) is defined using `DimList`.
Accessing elements in an `NDBuffer` is done using `IndexList` for coordinates, which are then converted to a 1D memory offset by *strided N-D to 1D indexing logic*.
The `AddressSpace` parameter allows these operations to be tailored for different memory systems, like CPU or GPU, for *optimal performance*.
