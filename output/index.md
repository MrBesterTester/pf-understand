# PF-Understand Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Two Tutorials for Mojo using Pocket Flow

## Tutorials

All in all, I did 4 fairly complete runs of Pocket Flow tutorializing abstractions.

- [Crawl4AI](./crawl4ai/) - a sanity check run for an existing repo already done in Pocket Flow's repo
- [Modular Max](./modular_max/) - When doing the entire Modular repo, it chose to do Max Engine, ignoring Mojo almost entirely.
- [Mojo v1](./mojo-v1/) - When focusing Pocket Flow on just the mojo folder in Modular's repo, a tutorial on its high-performance multi-dimensional array operation
- [Mojo v2](./mojo-v2/) - The final run of Pocket Flow which ran smoothly (no errors in about 1.75 hours) on resulted in a different tutorial for Mojo, this time focusing on Mojo's N-dimensional data structures

Using gemini-2.5-pro in Cursor, I did the following two comparisons:
- TBD: the first run above, sanity check on [Crawl4AI](./crawl4ai/) in the exisitng repo in `output/crawl4ai/`.
- TBD: the last two runs above, the two different versions of tutorials for Mojo.
I also did a comparison 

## Other notes TBD
