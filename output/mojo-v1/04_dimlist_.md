# Chapter 4: Describing Dimensions with `Dim` and `DimList`

In [Chapter 3: Working with Multiple Dimensions: `IndexList`](03_indexlist_.md), we learned about `IndexList`, a handy tool for representing coordinates or shapes with a fixed number of dimensions, where each dimension's size was a concrete number.

Now, we're going to explore a more specialized way to describe dimensions, particularly for `NDBuffer` (which we'll cover in the next chapter). Meet `Dim` and `DimList`!

The official description puts it well:
> `DimList` is a specialized list used by `NDBuffer` to define its structural properties, specifically its shape (the size of each dimension) and strides (the memory step size for each dimension). Imagine building with LEGOs; `DimList` would be like the part of the instructions telling you the length, width, and height of a particular block (shape) and how many studs to count in the flat array of all LEGO pieces to find the next piece in each respective direction (strides). `DimList` can handle both compile-time known (static) dimensions and runtime-defined (dynamic) dimensions, offering flexibility in defining tensor structures.

This means `DimList` is super useful because sometimes we know the exact size of our data when we write our code (static), and sometimes we only find out when the program runs (dynamic), like when loading an image file.

## The Building Block: `Dim`

Before we jump into `DimList`, let's understand its fundamental component: `Dim`.

A `Dim` represents a **single dimension's size**. The cool part is that this size can either be:
1.  **Statically Known**: The size is a specific number known when you compile your code (e.g., a dimension of size 5).
2.  **Dynamic (Unknown at Compile Time)**: The size isn't known until the program is running (e.g., the width of an image loaded from a file).

You'll need to import `Dim` (and `DimList`) from the `buffer.dimlist` module:
```mojo
from buffer.dimlist import Dim, DimList
```

### Creating `Dim`s

*   **Dynamic `Dim`**: If a dimension's size is unknown at compile time, you create a `Dim` without an argument:
    ```mojo
    var dynamic_dim = Dim()
    print(dynamic_dim) # Output: ?
    ```
    The `?` tells us this dimension's size is dynamic.

*   **Static `Dim`**: If the size is known, you provide it as an argument:
    ```mojo
    var static_dim = Dim(8)
    print(static_dim) # Output: 8
    ```

### Checking `Dim` Properties

`Dim` has helpful methods to tell you about its nature:

*   `has_value() -> Bool`: Returns `True` if the `Dim` has a static value, `False` if it's dynamic.
*   `is_dynamic() -> Bool`: Returns `True` if the `Dim` is dynamic, `False` if it has a static value. (This is the opposite of `has_value()`).
*   `get() -> Int`: If the `Dim` has a static value (`has_value()` is `True`), `get()` returns that integer value. **Caution**: Calling `get()` on a dynamic `Dim` might lead to unexpected results or errors; it's best to check `has_value()` first.

Let's see them in action:
```mojo
fn demo_dim_properties():
    var d_known = Dim(42)
    var d_unknown = Dim()

    print("d_known:")
    print("  Value:", d_known)             # Output: 42
    print("  Has value?", d_known.has_value()) # Output: True
    print("  Is dynamic?", d_known.is_dynamic())# Output: False
    if d_known.has_value():
        print("  Actual value:", d_known.get())# Output: 42

    print("d_unknown:")
    print("  Value:", d_unknown)             # Output: ?
    print("  Has value?", d_unknown.has_value()) # Output: False
    print("  Is dynamic?", d_unknown.is_dynamic())# Output: True
    if d_unknown.has_value(): # This block won't execute
        print("  Actual value:", d_unknown.get())
    else:
        print("  Actual value: Not available (dynamic)")

# To run the demo:
# demo_dim_properties()
```

### `Dim` Operations

`Dim` objects can also be part of simple arithmetic:
```mojo
fn demo_dim_ops():
    var dim8 = Dim(8)
    var dim2 = Dim(2)
    var dim_unknown = Dim()

    var dim_product = dim8 * dim2
    print(dim_product) # Output: 16 (because 8 * 2 = 16)

    var dim_product_with_unknown = dim8 * dim_unknown
    print(dim_product_with_unknown) # Output: ? (if one is unknown, result is unknown)

    var dim_div = dim8 // dim2
    print(dim_div)     # Output: 4 (because 8 // 2 = 4)
    print(dim_div.get()) # Output: 4
```
If any `Dim` in an operation is dynamic (`?`), the result is usually also dynamic.

## The List of Dimensions: `DimList`

Now that we understand `Dim`, a `DimList` is simply a list of `Dim` objects. It's used to represent a collection of dimension sizes, typically for the **shape** (e.g., height, width, channels of an image) or **strides** (how many steps to take in memory to get to the next element in each dimension) of an N-dimensional piece of data.

### Creating `DimList`s

You can create a `DimList` by providing `Dim` objects or integers (which will be converted to static `Dim`s) as arguments:

```mojo
fn demo_dimlist_creation():
    // All dimensions known
    var lst0 = DimList(1, 2, 3, 4)
    print("lst0:", lst0) # Output: lst0: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    // Some dimensions dynamic
    var lst1 = DimList(Dim(), 2, Dim(3), 4) // Dim() is dynamic, Dim(3) is static
    print("lst1:", lst1) # Output: lst1: [?, 2, 3, 4]

    // You can also create a DimList with all dimensions dynamic using `create_unknown`.
    // The number in the square brackets `[N]` must be known at compile time.
    // It tells Mojo how many dynamic dimensions to create.
    var lst_unknown = DimList.create_unknown[3]()
    print("lst_unknown:", lst_unknown) # Output: lst_unknown: [?, ?, ?]
```

### `DimList` Properties and Operations

`DimList` offers several ways to inspect and work with its dimensions:

*   **Length**: `len(my_dimlist)` gives you the number of dimensions (the rank).
    ```mojo
    var dl = DimList(5, 10, Dim())
    print("Length of dl:", len(dl)) # Output: Length of dl: 3
    ```

*   **Accessing `Dim`s**: `.at[index]()` returns the `Dim` object at a specific index. The `index` must be known at compile time.
    ```mojo
    var dl = DimList(10, Dim(), 30)
    var first_dim = dl.at[0]()
    var second_dim = dl.at[1]()
    print("First Dim:", first_dim)   # Output: First Dim: 10
    print("Second Dim:", second_dim) # Output: Second Dim: ?
    ```

*   **Accessing Static Values**: `.get[index]()` returns the integer value of the `Dim` at `index`, but *only if it's static*. Like `Dim.get()`, use with caution or after checking.
    ```mojo
    var dl = DimList(10, Dim(), 30)
    if dl.at[0]().has_value():
        print("Value of first dim:", dl.get[0]()) # Output: Value of first dim: 10
    ```

*   **Checking for Static Values**:
    *   `.has_value[index]() -> Bool`: Checks if the `Dim` at a specific `index` (compile-time known) has a static value.
        ```mojo
        var dl = DimList(Dim(), 20)
        print("dl.has_value[0]():", dl.has_value[0]()) # Output: dl.has_value[0](): False
        print("dl.has_value[1]():", dl.has_value[1]()) # Output: dl.has_value[1](): True
        ```
    *   `.all_known[count]() -> Bool`: Checks if the first `count` dimensions are all static. `count` must be known at compile time.
    *   `.all_known[start, end]() -> Bool`: Checks if dimensions in the range `[start, end)` are all static. `start` and `end` must be compile-time known.
        ```mojo
        var lst_all_known = DimList(1, 2, 3, 4)
        var lst_some_unknown = DimList(Dim(), 2, 3, 4)

        print("lst_all_known.all_known[4]():", lst_all_known.all_known[4]()) # Output: True
        print("lst_some_unknown.all_known[4]():", lst_some_unknown.all_known[4]()) # Output: False
        // Check only from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4
        print("lst_some_unknown.all_known[1, 4]():", lst_some_unknown.all_known[1, 4]()) # Output: True (dims at 1,2,3 are 2,3,4)
        ```

*   **Product of Dimensions**: `.product()` calculates the total number of elements if all dimensions were multiplied together.
    *   If all dimensions involved are static, it returns a static `Dim` with the product.
    *   If any dimension involved is dynamic (`?`), it returns a dynamic `Dim (`?`).
    *   You can also get the product of a sub-range: `.product[count]()` or `.product[start, end]()`.
    ```mojo
    var dl_static = DimList(2, 3, 4) # Product = 2*3*4 = 24
    print("Product of dl_static:", dl_static.product())             # Output: Product of dl_static: 24
    print("Product of dl_static:", dl_static.product().get())       # Output: Product of dl_static: 24

    var dl_dynamic = DimList(2, Dim(), 4)
    print("Product of dl_dynamic:", dl_dynamic.product())           # Output: Product of dl_dynamic: ?

    # Product of the first 2 elements of dl_static (2*3=6)
    print("Product of dl_static[0..1]:", dl_static.product[2]())    # Output: Product of dl_static[0..1]: 6
    ```

*   **Comparing `DimList`s**: You can check if two `DimList`s are equal (`==`). They are equal if they have the same length, and for each position, their `Dim`s are equal. (A static `Dim` is only equal to another static `Dim` with the same value. A dynamic `Dim` is equal to another dynamic `Dim`.)
    ```mojo
    fn demo_dimlist_eq():
        var d1 = DimList(Dim(), 42, Dim())
        var d2 = DimList(Dim(), 42, Dim())
        var d3 = DimList(1, 42, Dim())

        print("d1 == d2:", d1 == d2) # Output: d1 == d2: True
        print("d1 == d3:", d1 == d3) # Output: d1 == d3: False
    ```

## Why `DimList`? The Power of Static and Dynamic

The real strength of `Dim` and `DimList` comes from this ability to mix compile-time (static) and runtime (dynamic) information.

*   **Static Dimensions = Optimization**: If Mojo knows the exact shape of your data when it compiles your code (e.g., `DimList(10, 20, 3)`), it can perform many powerful optimizations. It can unroll loops, calculate memory offsets precisely, and generate highly efficient machine code.
*   **Dynamic Dimensions = Flexibility**: If your data's shape isn't known until your program runs (e.g., you ask the user for dimensions, or load a file), `DimList(Dim(), Dim(), Dim())` can represent this. Your code can then adapt to the actual sizes encountered at runtime.

`NDBuffer`, which we'll see next, uses `DimList` for its `shape` and `strides` parameters. This allows you to create `NDBuffer`s that are either fully optimized for a known shape or flexible enough to handle shapes determined on the fly.

## Examples from Tests

Let's look at a combined example inspired by `stdlib/test/buffer/test_dimlist.mojo`:

```mojo
from buffer.dimlist import Dim, DimList
from testing import assert_equal // A helper for tests, not strictly needed for understanding

fn main_dimlist_showcase():
    print("== DimList Showcase ==")

    var lst0 = DimList(1, 2, 3, 4)
    var lst1 = DimList(Dim(), 2, 3, 4) # First dimension is dynamic

    print("lst0:", lst0) # Output: lst0: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    print("lst1:", lst1) # Output: lst1: [?, 2, 3, 4]

    # Product
    # For lst0, all are known, so 1*2*3*4 = 24
    print("lst0.product[4]().get():", lst0.product[4]().get()) # Output: 24
    # For lst1, the first Dim is unknown, so product involving it is unknown
    # But product of lst1[1,4) (dims at index 1,2,3 -> 2,3,4) is 2*3*4 = 24
    print("lst1.product[1,4]().get():", lst1.product[1,4]().get()) # Output: 24
    # Overall product of lst1 is dynamic
    print("lst1.product():", lst1.product()) # Output: ?

    # all_known
    print("lst0.all_known[4]():", lst0.all_known[4]()) # Output: True
    print("lst1.all_known[4]():", lst1.all_known[4]()) # Output: False (due to first Dim)
    print("lst1.all_known[1, 4]():", lst1.all_known[1, 4]()) # Output: True (dims at 1,2,3 are known)

    # has_value for specific elements
    print("lst1.has_value[0]():", lst1.has_value[0]()) # Output: False (Dim() at index 0)
    print("lst1.has_value[1]():", lst1.has_value[1]()) # Output: True (Dim(2) at index 1)

    # String representations
    print("String(Dim()):", String(Dim()))                 # Output: ?
    print("String(Dim(33)):", String(Dim(33)))             # Output: 33
    print("String(DimList(2, Dim(), 3)):", String(DimList(2, Dim(), 3))) # Output: [2, ?, 3]

    # Creating fully unknown DimList
    var unknown_list = DimList.create_unknown[5]()
    print("DimList.create_unknown[5]():", unknown_list) # Output: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?]

# To run this example:
# main_dimlist_showcase()
```

## Summary

*   A `Dim` represents a single dimension's size, which can be **static** (known at compile time, e.g., `Dim(5)`) or **dynamic** (unknown until runtime, e.g., `Dim()`).
*   A `DimList` is a list of `Dim`s, used to define properties like `shape` and `strides` for multi-dimensional data structures.
*   `DimList` allows mixing static and dynamic dimensions, giving you both **optimization potential** and **runtime flexibility**.
*   Key `Dim` methods: `has_value()`, `is_dynamic()`, `get()`. Prints as a number or `?`.
*   Key `DimList` methods: `len()`, `.at[idx]()`, `.get[idx]()`, `.has_value[idx]()`, `.all_known[...]`, `.product[...]`. Prints as `[val1, ?, val3, ...]`.
*   `DimList.create_unknown[N]()` creates a list of `N` dynamic dimensions.

## What's Next?

With `Dim` and `DimList` under our belt, we're now perfectly equipped to understand how Mojo's primary N-dimensional data structure, `NDBuffer`, is defined and how it uses these tools to manage data of various (and variably known) shapes. Get ready for `NDBuffer` in Chapter 5!
